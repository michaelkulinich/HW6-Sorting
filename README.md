# HW6-Sorting
We’ve learned several sorting algorithms, as well as which algorithms are “asymptotically” better than others. But though it is important to know that, on paper, a O(n2 ) algorithm runs slower than a O(n lg n) algorithm, it is also important to realize just how drastically these algorithmic choices can effect your program’s performance at run time. To drive this point home, the (simple) assignment for this week is to implement 4 sorting algorithms and time them on large input.
